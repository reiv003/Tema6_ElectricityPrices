Did not figure out how to actually fix this, so I cheesed it by adding an empty label first so that the numbers would at least line up. The graph on https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html does touch the edge/match up to the first label properly, so I'm not sure what the issue is. It's not that the label is 00, the behavior is the same with a string or other number.   -->
